	<p>Let's keep it simple. Italics are good to help set it off from the body text. Be sure to style the citation.<br><br>
"If you go back a few hwndred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic-being able to talk to<br>
people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all<br>
things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago."
